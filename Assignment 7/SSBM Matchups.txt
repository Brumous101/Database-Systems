https://brumous.bitbucket.io/ I made an application that displays the win percentages for each character vs every other character 
in the game Super Smash Bros Melee. There's some bugs in it that I'm going to look over this weekend. When the user types "Mario"
 it returns results for "Dr. Mario" even though they are separate characters with different attack styles/ attributes. 
I'm also going to add graphics and things eventually as this was something I had a friend ask me about.
