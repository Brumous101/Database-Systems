3.1)
a) Relation - A table of information that is made up of attributes and domains.
b) Attribute - A distinct characteristic of the relation presented as the column.
c) Domain - The values that are permissable in regards to an attribute.
d) Tuple - A row of information in the table that is logically structured.
e) Intension - The structure and concept of a relation (all of ___ have this
this characteristic so it must be _____).
   Extension - The tuples in a relation that change over time (design). 
f) Degree - The number of columns / attributes / characteristics a relation has.
   Cardinality - The number of rows / tuples / entries a relation has.

3.2) A candidate key is a minimal super key that identifies all tuples as unique 
independent rows while the primary key is the candidate key that is picked for
a particular data point.

A foreign key is a key that connects two attributes that are the same in 
two different relations. This is different than a candidate key as a candidate key
is an entire tuple of data.

An example of a foreign key would be the name of a professor and the class being
taught. 

An example of a candidate key would be the name of a professor, the class being
taught, the time the class is being taught, the days being taught, the 
pre-requisite for the class, building name, and the room number.
An example of the primary key would be Professor Kosan, ETCO 2601-51, 5:30 PM,
