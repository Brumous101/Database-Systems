	An insertion anomaly would be creating a new patient in the system as there would need to be a Staff No
which is irrelevant to a new patient registering to the practice and an Appointment Date/ Time as they
may not be there for an Appointment at that time but are registering for a future date. 

	A deletion anomaly would occur when the deletion of a row containing a particular patient is deleted.
This would cause the dentist to move onto the next patient and the registration office to schedule other patients
during this already alloted time slot.

	An modification anomaly would occur when a patient goes back to the dentist and instead of getting a routine
cleaning the dentist pulls out a molar from the patient's mouth because while the patient was updated in the database
the Surgery No was not.

	To start the first normal form the table shown all of the columns and rows that intersect need to present one value. In
the table the only column that does not present this is the Appointment Date Time column which needs to be broken into
two separate columns. Next, the second normal form has an analysis of what can be used as primary keys in
different tables. In the example the Staff No, Patient No/5 would be the primary keys.
The Third Normal Form would be to create new tables to exclude redundancy in data so Staff relation would contain
Staff No, Staff Name and the Patient relation would contain the Pat No, and Pat Name and then some sort of appointment number
should be created as a primary key for the appointment relation. Finally, the relations are in BCNF as all the determinants are
would already be candidate keys through the normalization process of this example.
