	The main objective of a conceptual database is to meet the ends and goals of the person or persons using the database.

	A user view represents a particular interface that a group of people would use. Some ways of identifying user views
would be taking a look at the setup that is currently in use and prototyping what you think the userview should look like
based on the issues with the previous system until it is what the group wants out of the DBMS. Another way is to draw on paper
what the interface would look like and with each entry show what would happen with another piece of paper. This way would
show clarity from the user before programming something totally different than what is desired.

	1.) Identify entity types
	2.) Identify relationship types.
	3.) Identify and associate attributes with entity or relationship types.
	4.) Determine attribute domains.
	5.) Determine candidate and primary key attributes.
	6.) Specialize/generalize entity types (optional step).
	7.) Draw Entity-Relationship diagram.
	8.) Review local conceptual data model with user.

	The purpose of specialization of a database is to make it as specific as possible. The pros of this is it makes it more difficult the deeper you
go into the specification to confuse it with another thing. The cons of this is it becomes redundent and when having to merge databases it becomes 
incredibly difficult.
	The purpose of generalization is to simplify the information in a database. The pros of this is it is easy to understand. The cons of this
is it becomes easy to make anomalies in the databases and make errors.
	This becomes an issue either way when merging information from two different databases as some terms may mean different things.
