2.1) Data independence is the process of making different levels unaffected by changing lower levels.
Data independence is important because it allows users that are not familiar with database management systems
to interact with a system in a way that is easy to understand while still providing the lower levels the information needed
to function.
2.3) A data model is a collection of ideas for describing data, relationships between data, and limitations of data.
The main types of data is: the structural part which organizes the data in an easy to understand/ orderly way.
The manipulative part which is the operations that are able to be performed on the data.
The integrity part which proves accuracy of data.
2.4) The function of conceptual modeling is to provide a design or landscape that acts independently of everything else in
the DBMS. This is important because the concept is what makes everyone happy. If the concept is not agreed upon before
starting the process then different ideas are created and it becomes messy and overall bad.
2.8) Client-server architecture is the architecture where many personal computers can connect to one Local Area Network 
that then connects to a server often located on site to save costs. There's many advantages to this, as it allows the 
integrity check to be taken easier and more consistently. It also allows connection to more databases easier compared to
teleprocessing and file-server architecture.
